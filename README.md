# Business Overview

MedX Pharmacy is a leading pharmaceutical sales and distribution firm operating across multiple states in the U.S. The company works closely with healthcare distributors, hospitals, and retail pharmacies to guarantee timely access to high-quality medications. Managing an extensive portfolio of pharmaceutical products, MedX Pharma oversees several warehouse facilities and collaborates with sales representatives and third-party distributors to expand its market reach and effectively address increasing demand.

# Problem Statement

The company is facing escalating operational complexity driven by an expanding product portfolio, a growing customer base, and increased sales activities across various regions. Its dependence on static Excel files for storing essential sales, customer, and distribution data has led to difficulties in performance tracking and generating actionable insights. The lack of a centralized data management and reporting system hinders managementâ€™s ability to accurately identify top-performing products, sales representatives, and regions, thereby restricting timely, data-driven decision-making.

# Aim of the Project

âœ… This project seeks to convert MedX Pharmacyâ€™s data into a normalized, structured data model with the use of Power BI.

âœ… It aims to develop an interactive dashboard designed to analyze product sales, customer behavior, and sales trends. 

âœ… The initiative will enhance visibility into sales and distribution operations and support data-driven decision-making.

# Methodology

To achieve the data transformation, I:

âœ… Cleaned and organized the dataset in Excel  

âœ… Imported the data into Power BIâ€™s Power Query  

âœ… Transformed the data and developed a data model using fact and dimension tables, including a custom date dimension, with relationships established through primary and foreign keys 
 
âœ… Created calculated columns and DAX measures to enable advanced analytics 
 
âœ… Designed three interactive dashboards to provide strategic insights and enhance operational transparency

# Key Performance Insights & Recommendations

# Sales Trends Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Revenue Trends: Revenue oscillates within a $0.9M-$1.1M band, with observable surges in April, July, and December. These peaks align with potential seasonal factors or successful promotional activities. The pronounced contraction in June, however, merits investigation into its root causes, such as a market shift or internal challenges.


ðŸ”¹ Order Fulfillment Health: While October recorded the highest number of orders (454), November saw the maximum cancellations (167). The prevalence of substantial cancellations throughout the period suggests underlying issues, potentially related to inventory stockouts or customer experience shortcomings.


ðŸ”¹ Operational Efficiency: The monthly consistency of pending orders indicates a recurring bottleneck in the order fulfillment cycle, identifying a clear area for process improvement within the supply chain and logistics.


ðŸ”¹ Team Performance: Sales output varies significantly across the team. David Cox's leading results ($704K revenue, 273 orders) position him as a key subject for best practice analysis. Robert Bauer's lower performance metrics ($520K revenue, 228 orders) suggest a need for targeted development initiatives to align his output with team benchmarks.

ðŸ’¡
# Recommendation

ðŸ”¹ Address June Sales Slump: Investigate the root cause of the June revenue dip and launch targeted promotional campaigns or limited-time discounts to mitigate future seasonal declines.


ðŸ”¹ Minimize Order Cancellations: Analyze cancellation data to identify primary drivers (e.g., shipping delays, product issues). Implement solutions such as inventory forecasting improvements or proactive customer communication.


ðŸ”¹ Streamline Order Fulfillment: Audit and optimize the logistics and fulfillment pipeline to reduce the backlog of pending orders and accelerate delivery times.


ðŸ”¹ Enhance Sales Team Performance: Develop a support plan for lower-performing reps, incorporating mentorship, skill-based training, and performance-based incentives to boost productivity.


# Product Analysis 

- Revenue Distribution: Antiseptics (26.93%) and Vaccines (21.81%) are the highest-performing product categories. In contrast, Antibiotics contribute the least (14.73%), indicating potential market saturation, competitive pressures, or a need for strategic reassessment.

- Warehouse Efficiency: Warehouse C processes the majority of orders (67.28%), significantly outperforming Warehouse B (32.72%). This suggests superior operational efficiency or greater capacity at Warehouse C.

- Product Performance: Paracetamol is the top-selling product, generating $343K in revenue, closely followed by Fluconazole at $324K.

- Distributor Contribution: Johnson PLC is the leading distributor with $1.38M in revenue, with Wagner and Nichols also demonstrating strong performance. The tight revenue range among the top 10 distributors indicates a healthy and balanced partner network.


# Strategic Recommendation

- Antibiotics Category: Investigate the root cause of underperformance. Explore opportunities for revitalization through revised marketing, competitive pricing, or potential product line rationalization.

- Warehouse Optimization: Analyze the operational models of Warehouses B and C. Leverage best practices from Warehouse C to enhance B's performance and ensure optimal resource allocation and capacity planning.

- Sales Force Strategy: To improve productivity across 20 representatives managing 200 products, consider implementing a specialized structure. Assign reps by product category, region, or distributor to deepen expertise and efficiency.

- Distributor Management: Strengthen alliances with top-performing distributors like Johnson PLC. Develop tiered incentive programs to motivate mid-tier partners and elevate overall channel performance.


# Customer Analysis

MedX demonstrated robust growth in 2024, achieving $12.21M in total revenueâ€”a 10.31% increase month-over-month. This performance, driven by consistent growth in orders and volume, reflects effective commercial execution and strong customer engagement.

Key Insights:

- Market Segmentation: Revenue is concentrated within key healthcare providers, with Clinics (27.9%) and Hospitals (27.5%) constituting our primary customer segments, followed by Wholesalers (23.7%) and Pharmacies (20.9%).

- Client Concentration: The revenue base is reliant on a compact, high-value portfolio of 50 customers and 10 distributors. The top 10 clients each generate between $275Kâ€“$357K, representing a significant portion of total revenue.

- Geographic Penetration: Sales are highly concentrated in specific states, led by Michigan and New York. Notably, numerous states show zero activity, revealing a substantial opportunity for geographic expansion.


# Recommendation 

- Defend the Core: Protect and grow revenue from top segments (Clinics/Hospitals) and key accounts through tailored loyalty programs and dedicated relationship management.

- Expand Geographically: Prioritize market entry into inactive states through targeted marketing campaigns and by establishing new distributor partnerships.

- Optimize Commercial Terms: Review the 7.4% average discount rate to ensure pricing strategy effectively balances competitiveness with profitability across segments and regions.

- Build for Scale: Leverage current growth trends to accurately forecast 2025 demand, ensuring supply chain and operational readiness.

# Conclusion

In 2024, MedX achieved strong revenue growth and customer engagement, primarily driven by clinics and hospitals. While performance is solid, significant opportunity exists in geographic expansion and mid-tier customer growth. Operational improvements in sales deployment, warehouse balance, and fulfillment are needed. Future success hinges on strategic shifts: optimizing distributor and discount strategies, and addressing underperforming products like antibiotics. For 2025, MedX should focus on expanding into new regions, deepening key account relationships, and implementing data-driven forecasting. These steps position the company to scale its impact and profitability effectively.
